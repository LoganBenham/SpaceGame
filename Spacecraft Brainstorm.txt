weapons, shields, and sensors are sized
ships have immutable slots for components
ship slots can't be bigger than ship size
station modules have hp and shields individually

sensors, weapons, and engines should be targetable somehow?

            microwave: deep space point-point communication
            telescopes: sensing radiation sources of ranges of wavelengths
            everything has a diameter/radius value for sensing
        weapons
            projectiles: low range, high hull damage,
                    strong against small ships and missiles
            missiles: medium range, low shield damage,
                    very high hull damage, ineffective against small ships
            energy: high range, high shield damage,
                    high precision (used for component targeting)
            range-dependent accuracy
            tracking-dependent accuracy
            shield/hull damage
space ship travel
    switch between orbits and unbound trajectories
        leaving the bounds of an orbiter (leaving a planet, but could also be a moon or something)
            use velocity and focus of planet
            use position of ship
        leaving the bounds of a star
            accelerate to hyperbolic orbit (e>1)
            switch to unfocused at point where acceleration is negligible
        entering the bounds of an object
    thrusts
        impulse: instant simple dv calculation (usually rocket equation)
        finite: calculated as unfocused-thrusting trajectory
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacecraft_propulsion#Table_of_methods
    types of trajectories possible
        orbit
        hyperbolic
        unfocused-free
        unfocused-thrusting
    maneuvers
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_maneuver
        Hohmann transfer
            impulse thrust to boost to desired apoapsis
            impulse thrust to reach desired eccentricity
            can switch from/to planetary orbit at start and ending orbits
        gravity assist
